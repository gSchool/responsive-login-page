* jQuery

* * *

__Discuss the relationship between HTML, JavaScript, the DOM API, and jQuery:__
> Write your answer here...

HTML provides a structure for the front end of a project/theDOM, javascript and Jquery allow you to manipulate and append to that structure.

### Acceptance Criteria:

* The login form must be centered on a wide view
* The login button should take up the same width as an input box on a small view
* The password field correctly hides passwords
* HTML5 Form Validation is added to each input field
  * Email must be correctly formatted
  * Password must be longer than six characters
* On submission, the view stays the same (i.e. there is no page reload)
* If the form has no validation errors, the form is removed and a simple welcome message is displayed
  * Make sure to create a new element in memory for this welcome message

### Constraints:

* Do not use Bootstrap
* Do not use jQuery to validate forms
* Create the "Welcome Message" in memory before appending to the DOM.

### Objectives

We will be assessing the following:

__HTML:__
* Tags are in a logical order to match reality
* Tags are properly indented to show nesting visually
* Correctly uses attributes
* Use structural tags to create a semantic, usable form (label, fieldset)
* Build forms that use all HTML5 controls
* Labels are associated with form controls ("for" attribute)

__CSS:__
* Show and hide content intended for specific screens/screen sizes with media queries
* Creates CSS classes for groups of elements that behave similarly
* Selectors and rules are demarcated by usage, using comments and by grouping similar functionality

__JS/jQuery:__
* Create and Return a complex Element from a Function
* Can create new DOM Elements

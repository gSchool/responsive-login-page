## Acceptance Criteria:

- CHECK * The login form must be centered on a wide view
- CHECK * The login button should take up the same width as an input box on a small view
- CHECK * The password field correctly hides passwords
- CHECK * HTML5 Form Validation is added to each input field
- CHECK * Email must be correctly formatted
- CHECK * Password must be longer than six characters
- CHECK * On submission, the view stays the same (i.e. there is no page reload)
- CHECK * If the form has no validation errors, the form is removed and a simple welcome message is displayed
- CHECK * Make sure to create a new element in memory for this welcome message

## Constraints:

- CHECK * Do not use Bootstrap
- CHECK * Do not use jQuery to validate forms
- Create the "Welcome Message" in memory before appending to the DOM. ????

## Objectives

We will be assessing the following:

**HTML:**

- Tags are in a logical order to match reality
- Tags are properly indented to show nesting visually
- Correctly uses attributes
- Use structural tags to create a semantic, usable form (label, fieldset)
- Build forms that use all HTML5 controls
- Labels are associated with form controls ("for" attribute)

**CSS:**

- Show and hide content intended for specific screens/screen sizes with media queries
- Creates CSS classes for groups of elements that behave similarly
- Selectors and rules are demarcated by usage, using comments and by grouping similar functionality

**JS/jQuery:**

- Create and Return a complex Element from a Function
- Can create new DOM Elements

__Discuss the relationship between HTML, JavaScript, the DOM API, and jQuery:__
> HTML is the bricks and mortar of a site. It provides overall structure and functionality
of the site.  CSS is for styling a site and making it"fancy". Also utilizes pseudo
effects to let the user know where they are at with the pointer as well as highlighting
to show the user what page they are on.
Javascript allows for interactivity of the website ranging from simple
DOM manipulation to form validation.

### Acceptance Criteria:

* The login form must be centered on a wide view
* The login button should take up the same width as an input box on a small view
* The password field correctly hides passwords
* HTML5 Form Validation is added to each input field
  * Email must be correctly formatted
  * Password must be longer than six characters
* On submission, the view stays the same (i.e. there is no page reload)
* If the form has no validation errors, the form is removed and a simple welcome message is displayed
  * Make sure to create a new element in memory for this welcome message

### Constraints:

* Do not use Bootstrap
* Do not use jQuery to validate forms
* Create the "Welcome Message" in memory before appending to the DOM.

### Objectives

We will be assessing the following:

__HTML:__
* Tags are in a logical order to match reality
* Tags are properly indented to show nesting visually
* Correctly uses attributes
* Use structural tags to create a semantic, usable form (label, fieldset)
* Build forms that use all HTML5 controls
* Labels are associated with form controls ("for" attribute)

__CSS:__
* Show and hide content intended for specific screens/screen sizes with media queries
* Creates CSS classes for groups of elements that behave similarly
* Selectors and rules are demarcated by usage, using comments and by grouping similar functionality

__JS/jQuery:__
* Create and Return a complex Element from a Function
* Can create new DOM Elements
